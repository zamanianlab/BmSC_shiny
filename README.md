# Overview

This repository contains the R code and data to produce the interactive shiny application for exploring the _B. malayi_ microfilariae single-cell transcriptomic atlas. For more background information on how the data was generated, please consult the associated [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505865v1). 

The application is deployed at: https://zamanianlab.shinyapps.io/BmSC


Please submit application issues to this repository Issues board. 


## UMAP Exploration
This tab provides the user the opportunity to explore gene expression by UMAP and dotplot visualization. Users can search the data by submitting multiple gene inputs using the _B. malayi_ gene name or WBGene ID. 

## DEG Analysis
This tab contains data pertaining to differential expression analysis by cell type or by treatment. Visualization by volcano plot or exploration of the table provides the user with cluster or treatment-specific gene expression. 

## Downloads
All datasets used in the shiny app are available for download under this tab. In addition, the Seurat or AnnData objects of the entire _B. malayi_ microfilariae single-cell transcriptome, including the data for the cell population treated with ivermectin (1 Î¼M), can be downloaded for personal analysis from  [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7110316#.YzhFFOzMI6E).

# Running App Locally
This app can be run locally by cloning this repo to your machine if traffic on the server is heavy and the app is running slowly. The gene expression matrix (gene_expression_matrix.csv) will need to be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7110316#.YzhFFOzMI6E) or pulled from Google Drive (see R code) prior to running the app.
